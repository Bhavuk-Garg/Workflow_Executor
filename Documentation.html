    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
    <p>
        ASFT as an org has orchestrator systems which interacts with multiple other services(hosted on different platforms, EC2, Lambda, ECS etc.). An orchestrator or a workflow system is one which coordinates which multiple other services to achieve desired result for the customer.
        As an orchestrator:
        -- I should be able to define dependencies among tasks. eg. execute task B should be executed post task A.
        -- I should be able to execute multiple task in parallel.
        -- I should be call a task B only when output from task A meets certain criteria.
        say output of tasks A is a field X.
        if X == 'doB' then executeTaskB
        if X == 'doC' then executeTaskC
        -- I should able to define failure handling task for each of those tasks.
        -- I should be able to search execution of tasks in a workflow by a tagged id
        -- I should be able to support multiple type of tasks(Lambda, ECS etc.)
